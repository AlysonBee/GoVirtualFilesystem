# A Virtual Filesystem Coded in Go

This is a virtual filesystem I'm coding to teach myself Go in a fun way. I'm documenting it with a collection of Medium posts that you can find <a href="https://alysonn.medium.com/my-first-go-project-a-virtual-filesystem-9b46b2fe34a"/>here</a>.
<br>
The first few steps have been working on designing the overall structure of the code and the functions I'll be making use of for the duration of the project.<br>
This doc will be expanded as I work on it over the coming weeks.
